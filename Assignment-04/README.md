This week was a bit more difficult than others. Though I believe some of this came from my traveling, truly understanding some of the linking was difficult. But this week taught me a lot about various parts of how the internet works. And what to practice working on in looking forward towards developing online.

Browsers work by sending and receiving information from servers. This information is sent/received in a language such as HTML. This information is then rendered and shown in a corresponding place that the UI is coded for.
Personally I mostly surf the web with Google Chrome and occasionally Opera.

A markup language is a coding language that focuses more on the UI and text rather than behind the scenes work. With the most commonly used markup language being HTML. HTML focuses mostly on creating links and appearances for websites, as it formats the text and some visual content.

This week we definitely more difficult. However I think most of that is due to my traveling and business with family. The content itself is pretty interesting though, and I'm very excited to get into HTML. I have done some previous work with HTML in highschool, but now that I'm doing it again I wish I continued practicing in between now and then.
