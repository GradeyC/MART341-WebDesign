This week was a bit more difficult than others. Though I believe some of this came from my traveling, truly understanding some of the linking was difficult. But this week taught me a lot about various parts of how the internet works. And what to practice working on in looking forward towards developing online.

Browsers work by sending and receiving information from servers. This information is sent/received in a language such as HTML. This information is then rendered and shown in a corresponding place that the UI is coded for.
Personally I mostly surf the web with Google Chrome and occasionally Opera.

A markup language is a coding language that focuses more on the UI and text rather than behind the scenes work. With the most commonly used markup language being HTML. HTML focuses mostly on creating links and appearances for websites, as it formats the text and some visual content.

This week we definitely more difficult. However I think most of that is due to my traveling and business with family. The content itself is pretty interesting though, and I'm very excited to get into HTML. I have done some previous work with HTML in highschool, but now that I'm doing it again I wish I continued practicing in between now and then.

The site that I looked at was the 2010 version of YouTube. It's needless to say that it has changed quite a bit since then. The older version did have a very similar UI to modern YouTube, but much less refined. As well as it being much less vibrant, having less videos on a page and generally being smaller. With that the videos that were being recommended also differed. Being more focused on music videos and news. Where as now YouTube pushes large personalities both from the site, and from conventional media. The other large difference is the views. Now days videos that are recommended tend to have hundreds of thousands to millions of views. However a decade ago the views were huge if they got to the hundred thousands and low millions.

The last few topics that we've covered have definitely been a challenge. While being fun and teaching me about not just how to code for web design, but the history and function of it. These topics especially the coding has been somewhat rough. This week was much better, as it is beginning to click a bit more. However I would be lying if I said there wasn't a time where I got a little frustrated. I think that as we work a bit more with HTML it's beginning to become more understandable, with this week being the easiest for me to begin to understand.

Overall this week wasn't bad. I really enjoyed working with HTML and learning more about how it works. The most frustrating part was when my link to my About page wouldn't show after the text of my story. Beyond that however there was no real issue this week. I think that I'm going to start doing daily practices as to better remember both setting up an HTML file and how some of the elements work.

# Assignment 6

There are at least 10 different main head elements, while there are 4 for the body element. A document can have up to 6 heads while only having one body. With most of the elements in the body focusing on structure, with lists and paragraphs. While the heads focus on sumantics, having differnt tools to show differnt text. With things like abriations, underlining and italics.

The difference as touched on above between sumantic and structural markup. Is that structural focuses on creating the orginazation of a document. Using elements to create spacing and structure for the text of a given area. Where as semantic markup 
focuses mostly on expressing different gramatical elements. By citing,italicizing and abreviating to name a few. It is not as needed to some extent as structure, as text may still be understandable without the addition of the listed elements.

My workflow for this assignment was focused on a getting it done in a timely way while giving myself time to breath. Doing 30 minute- 1 hour long sessions of work. Then giving myself 15-30 minutes to take a break and work on something else or other things. It took me some time to actually figure out what I wanted to focus on for a recipe. Using some time to think of some of my favorite foods and going from there. I mostly focused on going in order that the homework page layed out, making sure to check it and mark off what I fufilled of the assignment as I went. Giving myself good structure and idea of what to focus on thinking about next.
