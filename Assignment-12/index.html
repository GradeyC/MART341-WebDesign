        <b> "THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal
            before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter
            than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was
            stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the
            211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing
            vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.
            <br>
            Some things about living still weren't quite right, though. April for
            instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in
            that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron's fourteenyear-old son, Harrison, away.
            It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn't think about it very
            hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn't
            think about anything except in short bursts.
            <br> 
            And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his
            ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a
            government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would
            send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair
            advantage of their brains."</b>

        <p id="ThoughtsOpening"> Personally, while this is a short excerpt.</p>
        <p>
            I found that it provides a good deal to think about. At least in context to the future.<br>
            As we get closer to having the ability to technologically and genetically modify people and things <br>
            to an ideal point. It makes you wonder what the cost of equality is to some extent. Not in social terms<br>
            of course, as socially everyone should be seen as an equal. But in terms of being, and ability the idea differs.<br>
            As in  the world of Harrison Bergeron, everyone is limited to be equal. Equally inattentive, slow, weak, ect... but outside of <br>
            the "utopia" this would make what would one gain? Looking and asking that I belive helps look at some of the absurd things <br>
            that have been done in the name of real world peace, progress or happiness.
