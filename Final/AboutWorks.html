             <li><u><b><h><a href="./images/PS1Abstract.jpg"> Whirlwind of the abstract:</b></u></h></a>This was one of my works from my first ever <br>
                           photoshop class that I took in the spring of 2019. Being somewhat inspired by the Tame Impala
                           cover art for the album <i>Currents</i>. I took many images and abstracted them into making this work.<br>
            </li>

            <li><u><b><h> <a href="./images/PS1flower.jpg">Flower:</b></u></h></a>
                           This was my first project practicing photo touchups and improvement in Photoshop. 
                           The photo was improved by using various color balances, light balancing and some of the burn tool to darken <br>
                           over exposed spots.
            </li>
         <hr>
            <li><u><b><h><a href="./images/PS1composite.jpg">Unnatural Environment:</b></u></h></a> 
               This work was one of my later ones for my photoshop class. Being a composite of several images I took and found.
               I did use my real arm as part of the composition, trying to create contrast between nature and technology.
               I really enjoy this work and would say it's one of my favorites from this class. However it is admittedly rushed/failed, in that
               some images used were not the right size, making them look distorted or blurry.
            </li>
         <hr>
            <li><a href="./images/PS1AlbumCover.jpg"><u><b><h> Cover:</b></u></h></a>
               This was another early work of mine. Being an album cover for the artist <i>Jake Chudnow.</i>
               Focused on communicating the very alien and spacey sound that Jake uses in his art. Making you feel like you're listening to something from
               another reality to some extent. 
            </li>

            <li><a href="./images/PS1type.jpg"><u><b><h> Typography:</b></u></h></a>
               This was my first project working with Typography in photoshop. Focused on creating a visual version of the saying <i>Busy as a bee.</i>
               While somewhat simplistic, the pattern does an ok job at communicating the business, with a focus on paper, and similar work related visuals. 
            </li>

         <li><a href="./images/PS1GifAnimation.gif"><u><b><h> Nature Programs:</b></u></h></a>        
            This gif was my final for this class, and is one of my all time favorite things that I've made. The gif similar to the composition,
            was somewhat themed on placing technology in nature and showing how that can be paradoxical. Watching nature programs while camping, makes 
            just as much sense as watching a cooking movie while cooking. The gif is about 10 seconds long, and uses about 10 images in total (not including transition slides).

          <li><u><b><h><a href="./images/PS2Daydream.jpg"> Daydream:</b></u></h></a>
               This and Helga were both some of my first works for this class. Being practice with using photo filters in Photoshop.
               Personally I love this work as it makes the tree look alien and abnormal while adding a warm feeling to the photo.
         </li>

         <li><u><b><h> <a href="./images/PS2Helga.jpg">Helga:</b></u></h></a>
                        This and Daydream, were made at the same time. However this work was an interesting late night shot of the street outside my dorm.
                        It interestingly brightened and darkened parts of the picture, making a image that recreates the feeling of walking in a town late at night.

         <li><u><b><h><a href="./images/PS2Cherries.jpg">Cherries:</b></u></h></a> 
            This work, was my first time making something completely new using only brushes in Photoshop.
            I was given the image of cherries, but figured to go with natural part of them being fruit.
         </li>
      <hr>
         <li><a href="./images/PS2Brushes.jpg"><u><b><h> Brushes:</b></u></h></a>
            This work was from the middle of the semester, and is mostly just random.
             It focused on creating my own brushes from photos, and then using them. I ended up
             using a mixture of the clone tool, and brushes to completely mixup the map. making it confusing to read as old maps can be.
         </li>

         <li><a href="./images/PS2Recolor.jpg"><u><b><h> Recolor:</b></u></h></a>
                  This was a simple work was just a recolor and digital repair of a photo given to me by my professor. 
                  I really enjoy how good it came out, and is something that I've continued practicing with family pictures.         </li>

         <li><a href="./images/PS2Type.jpg"><u><b><h> Island:</b></u></h></a>        
               This project, similar to the Typography that I made in Photoshop 1. However this project is more developed
               than the former. Using much better technique to give the image more cohesion and depth. The theme was around conveying a words meaning, through your visuals.

         <li><a href="./images/PS2WebsiteHomepage.jpg"><u><b><h> Home Page:</b></u></h></a>        
            This was the visual creation of a theoretical website. The website would be for a handyman company based in Alaska. This page was focused mostly on trying to visually balance and 
            create something pleasing to the eyes. 
         </li>

         <li><a href="./images/Ps2WebsiteSubpage.jpg"><u><b><h> Contact Page:</b></u></h></a>        
            This work was the second part of the website project, and was focused on making a realistic contact page. Trying to make it simple and realistic.

         <li><a href="./images/PS2MoodBoard.jpg"><u><b><h> Mood Board:</b></u></h></a>        
            This project was based on being a mood board for a theoretical client. A mood board is a group of images and colors with various edits to help get an idea of what someone wants for a project.
            While a mood board is a tool to help get an idea on what you're making, in itself it should be well designed. Which I tried to accomplish through editing and colors.

         <li><a href="./images/PS2Mockup.jpg"><u><b><h> Mockup:</b></u></h></a>

      <hr>
      <li><a href="./images/PS2PrintSetup.jpg"><u><b><h> Print:</b></u></h></a>        
         This was my final for the class, making a theoretical poster for the band <i>Lil' Smokies</i>. I tried to create a balance of imagery with something that screamed bluegrass to the viewer.
         With the focus being on the guitar, adding trees to give perspective to how large it was.

               This was a line art project that I made this semester for my Illustrator class. I focused on trying to make something that was almost illusion like.
               with differing angles and other small things to bring focus to the cobbled together shapes. I had a lot of fun drawing this, and it has started making me want to draw more.

               <b><u>I DON'T OWN THIS CONTENT</u></b>. I merely reedited it to have more drawn out scenes for fun. However I wanted to include it
               as it was a more for fun use of what I've learned over my few years in school. It was based on taking the doors and just repeating it for a while as that was a joke made by friends and myself.
